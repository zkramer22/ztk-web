                    I've been fascinated with computers ever since I first sat in front of my grandpa Tom's Apple Power Mac 6200 at the age of five. 
                    I grew up in the heart of the dot-com bubble, and I remember the AOL dial up tone.
                    I've jailbroken most of my gaming consoles & old phones, and my Macbook always has a Windows partition.
                    I have a healthy relationship with my screens, and when I do occasionally browse social media...my algorithms are <i>tuned</i>. No junk.

                    I've been building things for the web since 2018. While I've touched just about every part of the app deployment process, 
                    the frontend is where I bring the most to the table through thoughtful design and development. Creativity is my strong suit, and I love finding ways 
                    to make old patterns appear fresh & new.
                </p>

                    Outside of tech, I love being active outdoors. Skiing, snowboarding, and skating are my favorite forms of movement. 
                    I'm a musician as well; I consider music my sincerest passion of all â€“ especially the intersection between music & technology.
